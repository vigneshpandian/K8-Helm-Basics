#to install redis using values.yaml

helm install cache-server bitnami/redis -n helm-demo --values helm/redis/values.yaml

Alternatively you can also use --set 

helm install cache-server bitnami/redis -n helm-demo  --set auth.enabled=true  --set auth.password="narun"

But the recommed approach is to use values.yaml for version control purposes

Also, you can use upgrade to update the redis as well as configuration
helm upgrade cache-server bitnami/redis --values helm/redis/values.yaml -n helm-demo

#to see the status of helm your chart
helm status cache-server -n helm-demo

#to see the list of deployed charts
helm list -n helm-demo

#if you want to re-use the same values, as you need to supply the config during upgrade

helm upgrade cache-server bitnami/redis --reuse-values -n helm-demo
